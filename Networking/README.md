## Networking

#### SSL, TSL and HTTPS
SSL: Secure Sockets Layer, keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems. It makes sure that data transfered between systems impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to protect the data. Security is done using an encrypted link that connects the server and browser

TLS: transport layer security

HTTPS: a website is secured by a SSL certificate

#### TCP 3-way handshake
* Client sends a segment with SYN to server and informs the server about the client should start communication
* Server responses to client with SYN-ACK signal set
* Client acknowledges response from server and they both create a stable connection
