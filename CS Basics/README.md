## CS Basic Interview Questions

### C++ and OS
#### 1. C++ and C
Cis programming language, C++ supports both procedural and OOP such as overloading, templates, inheritance, virtual functions and friend functions. C++ supports references, C doesn’t. C use scanf() and printf() for input/output while C++ uses stream

#### 2. Linked List and stack
both are linear data structure
* stack: push, pop, isempty, LIFO, FILO, static memory allocation, so the size is fixed. Last in First out. Append to the end, pop and pop from the end.
* linked list: data is not stored in contiguous location, elements are linked using pointers, very fast in insertion and deletion. Each linked list contains a pointer to the next member in the list. Size is not fixed. Two pointers, one pointer: store the value of the variable, the other pointer: store the address of the next node, so there is no restriction in adding a new link list element in between.
* queue: First in Last out. Append to the end, pop from the beginning

#### 3. Multi-threading and multi-processing
* multi-threading: shared memory, but need to be careful about writing to and reading from the same memory at the same time. Not interruptible or killable, must run the same executable
* multi-processing: separate memory, hard to share objects between processing, Child processes are interruptible and killable, sharing data using IPC
	
#### 4. Thrashing
It is a state in which our CPU perform productive work less and swapping more. CPU is busy in swapping pages so much that it can not respond to other user program as much as required

#### 5. Cache write back and write through
* Cache: the technique of storing a copy of data temporarily in rapidly-accessible storage media
* Write through: data is written to main memory through cache immediately, so the main memory always has an up-do-date copy of the line. When a read is done, main memory can always reply with the requested date
* Write back: data is written to the cache and then I/O completion is confirmed.

#### 6. Stack and heap
* Stack: static memory allocation. Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is very fast. LIFO. You can use Stack if you know exactly how much data you need to allocate before compile time and it is not too big.
* Heap: dynamic memory. Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing to memory is slow. You can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time. This makes it complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time 

In a multi-threaded situation each thread will have its own compeletely independent stack bu they will share the heap. Stack is thread specific and Heap is application specific

#### 7. References and pointers
* Similarity: can be used to change local variables of one function inside another function. Can be used to save copying of big objects when passed as arguments to function or returned from functions
* Difference: references are less powerful than pointers. (1) once a reference is created, it can not be later made to reference another object. It can not be reseated. (2) reference can not be null while pointers are often made null to indicate that they are not pointing to any valid thing. (3) reference must be initialized when declared. But no restriction in pointers. 

* reference can not be used for implementing data structure such as linked list tree. But in java, no pointers, only reference because no above restrictions.
* reference are safer (no wild pointers) easier to use
* difference: pointers: *, reference: &

#### 8. Virtual
For function overloading (same class name, different parameters type or different return parameters )

#### 9. Pointer
“this” pointer is a constant pointer holding the address to the current object

#### 10. Difference between java and c++
* Java: automatic garbage collections, does not support pointers, templates, unions, operation overloading, built-in thread class, only has method overloading, platform independent 
* C++: destruction, automatically invoked when objects are destroyed, no built-in class, support inheritance, method overloading and operator overloading 

#### 11. Child class is not allowed to access private members of parent

#### 12. Operation overloading and function overloading

#### 13. Copy constructor
It is a member function which initializes an object using another object of the same class. Such as x = y. It is called when an object is passed by value or when an object is returned by a function or when compiler generates a temporary object. It can be made private.

#### 14. i++ is more expensive than ++i, because i++ makes a copy of the element before incrementing I and then return the copy

#### 15. difference between class and struct
Struct members are public by default, class members are private

#### 16. static and const
* Static const: meaningless
* const: member function which isn’t allowed to modify the members of the object for which it is called	
* static: member function which can not be called for a specific object

so static const is meaningless because no object is associated with the call

#### 17. Storage class
a class that specifies the life and scope of its variables and functions. These storage class are supported: auto, static, register, extern, mutable

#### 18. How to avoid conflict when two threads are trying to access one resource
When two threads are trying to access one resource, it might cause race condition, such as one program try to x = x + 1 and the other tries x = x - 1.
* mutual exclusion, atomicity is often achieved through mutual exclusion - the constraint that execution of one thread excludes all the others. Using mutex. A thread attempts to lock the mutex then the attempt atomically either succeeds or it blocks the thread that attempted the lock. (critical section) —> starvation, deadlock 
* semaphore: 锁是服务于共享资源的；而semaphore是服务于多个线程间的执行的逻辑顺序的。c = a + b, c的执行必须要等待a b执行完之后才可以进行，所以需要semaphore进行调度。

#### 19. Polymorphism
It can be achieved by overriding. It refers to the ability of an object to provide different behaviours depending on its own nature. Same method name, different implementation.  Modifying / replacing the behaviour. Also operation overloading is also related to polymorphism. “+”. Overloading is unrelated to polymorphism, different parameters different types. Because such as when you define a function sum(int a, int b) then later you realize that you need another function that takes float as parameters. So without overloading, you have to remember the name method which is having exact set of parameters. But overloading just make it one name with different parameters.

#### 20. Why polymorphism is necessary?
It is necessary because let’s say you have a class of People, and 2 derived classes boys and girls. Then when you call the same method, you don’t need to know all the derived class and determine which methods to call. It will call the right method based on the object.

#### 21. Interrupt
It is a signal from a device attached to a computer or from a program within the computer that requires the os to stop and figure out what to do next. The computer can decide to handle the interrupt first, and remember the state of the currently working program. After it finishes the interrupt it can go back to the current task. Hardware interrupt (no input from keyboard), software interrupt

#### 22. Find a circle in linked list  
fast slow pointers, if cycle, they will finally meet. Use (while fast and fast.next) for condition, because it there is cycle, then it will terminate the loop, no cycle will terminate the loop too!!

#### 23. What is binary tree?  
It is a tree data structure that in which node has at most two children, left and right

#### 24. Process and procedure
process: computation
procedure: function

#### 25. Tail recursion
`It will execute an iterative process in constant space even if the iterative process is described by a recursive procedure. An implementation with this property is called tail-recursive`. Difference between Tail Recursion and other recursion is how they utilize memory. Tail Recursion use constant memory while other resursion grow linearly with n. Memory for `recsum` grows.  
```Python
def recsum(x):
	if x == 1:
		return x
	else:
		return x + recsum(x-1)

```
In `tail_recsum`, `y` is updated 
```Python
def tail_recsum(x, running_total = 0):
	if x == 0:
		return running_total
	else:
		return tail_recsum(x-1, running_total + x)
```

### Python
#### 1. Difference between list and tuples
* list: mutable, they can be edited, slower than tuples
* tuple: immutable, can not be edited, faster than lists

#### 2. key features
* interpreted language: does not need to be compiled before it is run
* dynamically typed: don’t need to state the variable type before when you declare them
* functions are first-class objects
* writing python code is quick but running is slower than compiled language, but it allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away such as numpy package
* python is used in many spheres such as web automation scientific modelling big data

#### 3. First class functions
* functions are objects: assign the function to a variable
* functions can be passed as arguments to other functions: greet(shout), greet(whisper) 
* functions can return another function

#### 4. Shallow copy and deep copy
* shallow copy: copy the reference pointers just like it copies the values, changes can affect the original copy. If we change any nested objects in original data, then copy will also be changed. If not nested objects, then copy is not affected, like append.
* deep copy: store the values that are already copied, it does not copy the reference pointers to the objects. It makes the reference to an object and the new object that is pointed by some other object gets stored. If makes changes to original data, then the deep copy one is not affected at all

#### 5. How is Multithreading achieved in Python
* Python has a multi-threading package but if you want to multi-thread to speed your code up, then it’s usually not a good idea to use it.
* Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL makes sure that only one of your ‘threads’ can execute at any one time. A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread. 
* This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your threads are executing in parallel, but they are really just taking turns using the same CPU core.
* All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution. This means that if you want to make your code run faster then using the threading package often isn’t a good idea.

#### 6. Ternary operations
The Ternary operator is the operator that is used to show the conditional statements. This consists of the true or false values with a statement that has to be evaluated for it. Such as: min = a if a < b else b 

#### 7. How is memory managed in Python?
* Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead. 
* The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code. 
* Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.

#### 8. Inheritance
one child class to gain attributes and methods from super class. 
* single inheritance: acquires the members of a single super class
* multi-level inheritance: derived class 2 is inherited from derived class 1 and d1 is inherited from base class 1

#### 9. Flask
Microframework based on werkzeug, jinja2 as dependencies, so it has little dependencies on external libraries. A session basically allows you to remember information from one request to another. In a flask, a session uses a signed cookie so the user can look at the session contents and modify. The user can modify the session if only it has the secret key Flask.secret_key.

#### 10. dir()
The dir() function is used to display the defined symbols

#### 11. Whenever Python exits, why isn’t all the memory de-allocated
* Whenever Python exits, especially those Python modules which are having circular references to other objects or the objects that are referenced from the global namespaces are not always de-allocated or freed. 
* It is impossible to de-allocate those portions of memory that are reserved by the C library.
* On exit, because of having its own efficient clean up mechanism, Python would try to de-allocate/destroy every other object.

#### 12. What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it
We use *args when we aren’t sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass a stored list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargsis used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments will be passed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers args and kwargs are a convention, you could also use *bob and **billy but that would not be wise.

#### 13. Write a one-liner that will count the number of capital letters in a file. Your code should work even if the file is too big to fit in memory.
count = sum(1 for line in fh for character in line if character.isupper())

#### 14. Randomize items in a list in place
```Python
from random import shuffle
s = [1,2,3,4]
shuffle(s)
```

#### 15. Sorting function for numerical dataset
```Python
list = [“1”, “2”, “4”]
list = [int(i) for I in list]
list = sorted(list)
```

#### 16. sub() and subn()
* sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different string
* subn() – it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements.

#### 17. Random
* randrange(a, b): [a, b)
* uniform(a, b): floating point number that is defined in the range of [a, b)
* normalvariate(mean, sdev): used for the normal distribution mu is mean and side is sigma the is used for standard deviation
Range and xrange
* range: return python list object
* xrange: return an xrange object, used when the range is really large such as one billion to avoid memory error

#### 18. Pickling and unpickling
Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.

#### 19. Save an image with url known
```Python
import urllib.request
urllib.request.urlretrieve(“URL”, “filename.jpg”)
```  

#### 20. Map function
execute the function (first argument) on all the elements of the iterable (second argument)

#### 21. get indices of N maximum values in a NumPy array?
```Python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])
print(arr.argsort()[-3:][::-1])
```

#### 22. Calculate percentiles 
p = np.percentile(a, 50) #50%

#### 23. List
general-purpose containers, efficient insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation.  Limitation: don’t support vectorized operations, such as element wise addition and multiplication. List can contain different types of elements, so need to execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.

#### 24. Numpy
convenient, lots of vector and matrix operations for free. It is faster and get lots of built in functions for fast searching, linear algebra and histogram

#### 25. Explain the use of decorators
Decorators in Python are used to modify or inject code in functions or classes. Using decorators, you can wrap a class or function method call so that a piece of code can be executed before or after the execution of the original code. Decorators can be used to check for permissions, modify or track the arguments passed to a method, logging the calls to a specific method, etc

#### 26. 3D plot
Like 2D plotting, 3D graphics is beyond the scope of NumPy and SciPy, but 3D plot is provided by matplotlib

#### 27. Dictionary is created by specifying keys and values, so d = {} is not creating a dictionary

#### 28. When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
when no exception occurs

#### 29. What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform static analysis?
PyChecker is a static analysis tool that detects the bugs in Python source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug. Pylint is another tool that verifies whether the module meets the coding standard

#### 30. How are arguments passed by value or by reference?
Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. The references values are according to the functions; as a result you cannot change the value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable

#### 31. What is Dict and List comprehensions are?
They are syntax constructions to ease the creation of a Dictionary or List based on existing iterable, such as: [x for x in old_list] [ x for x in range(0, 15)]

#### 32. Built-in types in python
* mutable: list, sets, dictionaries
* immutable: strings, tuples, numbers

#### 33. Namespace
like a dic, key is the name of the variables, value is the real value of that variable. Python中，每个函数都有一个自己的命名空间，叫做local namespace，它记录了函数的变量。python中，每个module有一个自己的命名空间，叫做global namespace，它记录了module的变量，包括 functions, classes 和其它imported modules，还有 module级别的 变量和常量。还有一个build-in 命名空间，可以被任意模块访问，这个build-in命名空间中包含了build-in function 和 exceptions。当python中的某段代码要访问一个变量x时，python会在所有的命名空间中寻找这个变量，查找的顺序为: local, global, built-in (error: namerror)

#### 34. Lambda
It is a single expression anonymous function often used as inline function.

#### 35. Why lambda forms in python does not have statements?
A lambda form in python does not have statements as it is used to make new function object and then return them at runtime

#### 36. What is unittest in Python?
A unit testing framework in Python is known as unittest. It supports sharing of setups, automation testing, shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections etc.

#### 37. Slicing
A mechanism to select a range of items from sequence types like list, tuple, strings etc. is known as slicing.

#### 38. Generator
L = [x for x in range(10)], g = (x for x in range(10))
* yield: generator, when it calls .next() return results when meets yield, next time will continue from yield
The way of implementing iterators are known as generators. It is a normal function except that it yields expression in the function.

#### 39. Docstring
A Python documentation string is known as docstring, it is a way of documenting Python functions, modules and classes

#### 40. What is module and package in Python?
In Python, module is the way to structure program. Each Python program file is a module, which imports other modules like objects and attributes. The folder of Python program is a package of modules. A package can have modules or subfolders.

#### 41. How can you share global variables across modules?
To share global variables across modules within a single program, create a special module. Import the config module in all modules of your application. The module will be available as a global variable across modules.

#### 42. Explain how can you make a Python Script executable on Unix?
Script file's mode must be executable and the first line must begin with # ( #!/usr/local/bin/python)

#### 43. Delete a file in Python?
By using a command os.remove (filename) or os.unlink(filename)

#### 44. Mention five benefits of using Python?
* Python comprises of a huge standard library for most Internet platforms like Email, HTML, etc.
* Python does not require explicit memory management as the interpreter itself allocates the memory to new variables and free them automatically
*	Provide easy readability due to use of square brackets
*	Easy-to-learn for beginners
*	Having the built-in data types saves programming time and effort from declaring variables

#### 45. Explain what is the common way for the Flask script to work?
Either it should be the import path for your application Or the path to a Python file

#### 46. Is Flask an MVC model
Basically, Flask is a minimalistic framework which behaves same as MVC framework. So MVC is a perfect fit for Flask

#### 47. Explain database connection in Python Flask?
Flask supports database powered application (RDBS). Such system requires creating a schema, which requires piping the shema.sql file into a sqlite3 command. So you need to install sqlite3 command in order to create or initiate the database in Flask.

#### 48. Flask allows to request database in three ways
* before_request() : They are called before a request and pass no arguments
*	after_request() : They are called after a request and pass the response that will be sent to the client
*	teardown_request(): They are called in situation when exception is raised, and response are not guaranteed. They are called after the response been constructed. They are not allowed to modify the request, and their values are ignored.

#### 49. Name the File-related modules in Python?
Python provides libraries / modules with functions that enable you to manipulate text files and binary files on file system. Using them you can create files, update their contents, copy, and delete files. The libraries are : os, os.path, and shutil. Here, os and os.path – modules include functions for accessing the filesystem shutil – module enables you to copy and delete the files.

#### 50. Explain the use of with statement?
In python generally “with” statement is used to open a file, process the data present in the file, and also to close the file without calling a close() method. “with” statement makes the exception handling simpler by providing cleanup activities.
* General form of with: with open(“filename”, “mode”) as file-var: processing statements...
* note: no need to close the file by calling close() upon file-var.close()

#### 51. file processing modes
r, w, rw, text file, add option ’t’, so: rt, wt, rwt, binary file, add option ‘b’

#### 52. Sequence
str, list, tuple, unicode, byte array, xrange, and buffer

#### 53. Display the contents of text file in reverse order?
```Python
For line in reversed(list(open(“file-name”,”r”))): 
  print(line)
```

#### 54. Name few Python modules for Statistical, Numerical and scientific computations?
NumPy – this module provides an array/matrix type, and it is useful for doing computations on arrays. scipy – this module provides methods for doing numeric integrals, solving differential equations, etc pylab – is a module for generating and saving plots
	
#### 55. What is multithreading?
It means running several different programs at the same time concurrently by invoking multiple threads. Multiple threads within a process refer the data space with main thread and they can communicate with each other to share information more easily.Threads are light-weight processes and have less memory overhead. Threads can be used just for quick task like calculating results and also running other processes in the background while the main program is running.

#### 56. Methods that are used to implement Functionally Oriented Programming in Python?
* filter() – enables you to extract a subset of values based on conditional logic.
*	map() – it is a built-in function that applies the function to each item in an iterable.
*	reduce() – repeatedly performs a pair-wise reduction on a sequence until a single value is computed. reduce把结果继续和序列的下一个元素做累积计算

#### 57. The argument given for the set must be an iterable. Not correct: set([[1,2],[3,4]])

#### 58. Decorator
Decorators are callable objects which are used to modify functions or classes. Function decorators are functions which accepts function reference as arguments and adds a wrapper around them and returns the function with the wrapper as a new function


#### 59. graph questions: how to traverse a directed graph
linked list and arrays are linear, tree and graph are non-linear. Directed graph has no cycle (directed acyclic graph DAG)
* bfs or dfs
* bfs: (use visited array)
```Python
def bfs(graph, start, end):
	visited, queue = set(), collections.deque([start])
	visited.add(start)
	while(queue):
		vertex = queue.popleft()
		for neighbour in graph[vertex]:
			if neighbour not in visited:
				visited.add(neighbour)
				queue.append(neighbour)
```
```Python
def bfs_shortest_path(garph, start, end):
	visited = []
	queue = [[start]]
	while(queue):
		path = queue.pop(0)
		node = path[-1]
		if node not in visited:
			neighbours = graph[node]
			for neighbour in neighbours:
				new_path = list(path)
				new_path.append(neighbour)
				queue.append(new_path)
				if neighbour == end:
					return new_path
			visited.append(node)

def dfs(graph): #recursively running dfs 
```

#### 60. How to create a data structure to store the graph
dictionary, key: is the node, the array stores the neighbours that start from node
* if directed such as a—>b—>c
```Python
dic = {“a”: [b], “b”: [c]}
```
* if undirected: such as a <—> b <—> c
```Python
dic = {“a”: [b], “b”: [a, c], “c”:[b]}
```

### Other

#### 1. PKI: public key infrastructure
Purpose: to facilitate the secure electronic transfer information for a range of network activities such as e-commerce, internet banking.. when simple passwords are inadequate authorization method, a more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication. Then an organization establishes and maintains a trustworthy networking environment by data encryption and high levels of authentication.

比尔自己的私人钥匙就是private key, 他发给别人的证明书的钥匙就是public key，所有通过这个私人钥匙加密的文件只有通过比尔自己的私人钥匙才能打开。

Public-key encryption and digital signature services

#### 2. Oauth
To make client get the authorization of a user and interact with HTTP service. Just as you need to print the photos that stored in google cloud and then a website can help to print the photos for you. Then printing website need to have the right to access your photos. If you just use simple username and password then there will be some serious problems for this. 
* Client will remember your password and username, but you don’t want that. 
* Google need to have the log in process designed for you but that is not safe. You can not control which kind of documents can be accessed by client, because it can access all of your information there. User can only withdraw this authorization by changing the password which is very inconvenient.
* Once the third-party application is destroyed or hacked by others then users information can be stolen by them easily.

Oauth: have a authorization layer between client and http server. Then the client can only access the authorization layer using the tokens that it gets. The token is different from users’ password so this can be separated. Then the user can decide the time and scope of authority so that the client is not accessing other information that users have. After client log in to the authorization layer, the http server can open the information stored there by recognizing the tokens.


#### 3. http
http is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. A web application might be the client and the application on a computer that hosts a web site might be the server. For example, a browser sends the http request to the server then the server return a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content. There are several methods: 

* get: request data from a specified resource
* post: send data to a server to create / update a resource
* put: sent data to a server to create / update a resource

Difference between post and put: calling the put request multiple times will always produce the same result but calling a post request repeatedly will have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times

head: same as get, but with the response body

#### 4. TCP/IP
It specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. 

It is divided into four layers. 
* Application layer 
* Transport layer: is responsible for maintaining end-to-end communications across the network 
* Network layer: also internet layer, deals with packets and connects independent networks to transport the packets across network boundaries. 
* Physical layer

advantages: it is compatible with all operating systems, so it can communicate with any other system. It is highly scalable and as a routable protocol, can determine the most efficient path through the network
	
#### 5. Make automake cmake
* make: use to execute makefile. In C or C++, when we only have one source file, then we can use gcc to compile it but what if we have lots of files and they have some dependency, then we can not do it one by one so we have make.
* makefile is kind of similar to batch processing script file, its basic syntax is like: target, dependency and then command, for example when we need to compile c file, then we can make the makefile like this: 
	
** hello: hello.o gcc -o hello hello.o     
** hello.o: hello.c gcc -c hello.c

however, for make and makefile they are under the environment in such as unix and it is not friendly to windows users so that is why we have cmake which is for cross-platform project management tool. For cmake, we have cmakelists.txt file. 

Therefore, make is used to execute makefile  and cmake is used to execute cmakelists.txt. if the project is not large we can write the makefile manually but what if is very large we can use automate to generate the makefile for us.
	
#### 6. Docker
For software development, one difficulty is about setting the environment because we have different kinds of os, so how can we ensure that a program can run in different machines. So that is people proposed virtual machine that you only need to develop in one environment and then it can run in other machines too. however, there are some disadvantages about vm. It will take lots of resource in your computer such as memory and space. second, it is very complex to finish it and it is slow. So then linux proposed linux container to solve the above problems. Linux container is not a whole os, but it tries to separate the different processes. So it is fast, take less resources and the container is small. So docker is one of the wrapping of linux container which provide very friendly api. Docker will put the program and its dependencies inside one folder and once this folder is executed, a virtual container will be generated and the program will run inside this container. You don’t need to worry about the environment anymore. 
 
#### 7. Linux command line
* cd, cd -, pwd, dirs, ls, cat filename.txt, grep, nano, 
* manipulate files: cp, mv, rm -rf folder, mkdir, chmod, chown  
* system info: df, free, top, ifconfig

#### 8. Transaction
Transaction can be defined as a group of tasks. A transaction is a very small unit of a program and it may contain several low-level tasks. A transaction may contain atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) properties. 

#### 9. Life cycle of an activity in android
activity starts —> onCreate() —> onStart() —> onResume() —> activity running —> onPause() —> onStop() —> onDestroy() —> activity shut down

#### 10. Heap
Priority queue is often referred as heap. The parent node’s value is always larger than or equal to the child’s value (max heap). In heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root.
